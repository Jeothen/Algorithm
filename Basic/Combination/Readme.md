# Combination



* The number of cases where k can be selected from n
* The folmula as below


$$
{n\choose k}  == {\frac {P(n,k)}{k!}}={\frac {n!}{k!\cdot (n-k)!}}
$$


* Implemented as full search for all possible combinations, not simple number of cases



* Recursive combination allows duplication of elements.
