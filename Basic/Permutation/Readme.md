# Permutation



* Selecting r items from n different elements without duplicates and arranging them in order
* The folmula as below


$$
n{\rm P}_r = \dfrac{n!}{(n-r)!}
$$


* Implemented as full search for all possible combinations, not simple number of cases



* Recursive permutation allows duplication of elements.
